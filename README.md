## Retinal data used in `Inferring hidden structure in multilayered neural circuits`

This repository contains data used in the paper [Inferring hidden data in multilayered neural circuits](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/14/120956).

The data consists of the responses of 23 salamander retinal ganglion cells in response to 40 minutes of a spatiotemporal white noise stimulus.

These data were used to fit linear-nonlinear (LN) and multilayered linear-nonlinear (LN-LN) models to retinal data.
The example scripts provided show how to fit these models on this data using the open source [nems](https://github.com/ganguli-lab/nems) package.
